TODO

	1. User input verifies that there are no illegal characters in grade, category, semester, or course names. Only letters and numbers.
	2. Add in variable drop lowest grade from a given category
	3. Create CourseDriver to handle uninitalized courses and grade data
	4. Diversify GradesDriver edit functions for category to be editCategoryName, editCategoryWeight and fix editGrade to use setGrade, setGradeName, setGradeEarnedPoints, and setGradeTotalPoints
	5. Set up cumulative GPA in SemesterDriver
	6. Set up semesters to have an "active" semester that is always loaded, and have a set of other semesters that only have the season and year activated, not the other drivers activated
	7. Solve seg fault after deleting 3 semesters in UserInterface
	8. Move drivers to operate on indicies of objects in them instead of names and try catching them with an option for failure, use the get[object]Index(string fullName) to get the index
	9. Add in breaks to all edit/delete functions so if nothing is there they can fail out of getting them, possibly doing so when the function is called
