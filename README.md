# GpaCalculator

The purpose of this app is to be able to more easily figure current GPA,  as well as eventually speculating what final grade is needed to complete the course with an A because tools for this are rather lacking that are both provided by KU and for online use. 

Moreover, this project has been both my introductory project to Github as a personal user, instead of using BitBucket at work,to rebuild this project that I lost back in January due to a computer crash and no recent backups, and to serve as a refresher course on C++ after programming in PHP for the entire summer of 2018.

The main long term goal of this project now is to integrate the C++ data configuration side of this app into either the Java Native Interface or to wrap the classes into Python objects and treat the functions more as endpoints than runtime data adjustments.
